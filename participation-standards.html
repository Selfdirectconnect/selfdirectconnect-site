    <h2>Participation Standards</h2>
    <p>
      SelfDirectConnect is being built to strengthen clarity, accountability,
      and coordination within the self direction ecosystem.

      families, professionals, and the integrity of the system.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h3>1. Opt In Participation</h3>
    <p>
      No professional profile will be published without explicit consent.
      Participation is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time,
      subject to active engagement policies.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Verification and Accuracy</h3>
    <p>
      Participants are responsible for ensuring that all submitted information
      is accurate and current.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Professional credentials</li>
      <li>Service scope</li>
      <li>Areas of expertise</li>
      <li>Organizational affiliation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Misrepresentation may result in profile suspension or removal.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Structured Profile Framework</h3>
    <p>
      Profiles follow a standardized format to ensure clarity and fairness.
      They are structured representations, not marketing pages.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Moderated Feedback Framework (Future Phase)</h3>
    <p>
      A structured feedback system is planned for a future phase.
      When implemented, it will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow defined submission guidelines</li>
      <li>Prohibit defamatory or unverified claims</li>
      <li>Include a dispute and review process</li>
      <li>Allow contextual response where appropriate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      SelfDirectConnect reserves the right to moderate,
      delay, or decline publication of submissions.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Professional Conduct Expectations</h3>
    <p>Participants agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain respectful communication</li>
      <li>Avoid misleading service representations</li>
      <li>Engage in good faith</li>
      <li>Follow platform participation rules</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Platform Integrity</h3>
    <p>
      SelfDirectConnect may update participation standards as the platform evolves.
      The platform reserves the right to suspend participation,
      remove inaccurate content, and enforce moderation policies.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>
      Self direction continues to grow. As it grows, structure becomes essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participation on SelfDirectConnect is not simply about visibility.
      It is about contributing to a more organized, accountable,
      and coordinated ecosystem.
